# Stripe Payment Integration Implementation

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### 1. Payment Service Setup
- [x] Created `src/lib/payment-service.ts` with Stripe integration
- [x] Implemented `createPaymentIntent` function
- [x] Implemented `handleSuccessfulPayment` function
- [x] Added proper error handling and logging

### 2. API Endpoints
- [x] Updated `/api/checkout/split` to create payment intents for Stripe
- [x] Created `/api/checkout/confirm` for payment confirmation
- [x] Added authentication and authorization checks
- [x] Implemented order status updates and payment recording

### 3. Frontend Components
- [x] Created `StripePaymentForm` component with secure card input
- [x] Updated `CheckoutPopup` to integrate Stripe Elements
- [x] Added proper error handling and loading states
- [x] Implemented payment success/failure callbacks

### 4. Environment Setup
- [x] Added Stripe publishable key environment variable
- [x] Ensured Stripe secret key is configured in server environment

## Testing Requirements

### Critical Path Testing
- [ ] Test payment intent creation with valid cart data
- [ ] Test payment confirmation with successful Stripe payment
- [ ] Test error handling for failed payments
- [ ] Test order status updates after successful payment
- [ ] Test cart clearing after successful payment

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Test with invalid payment methods
- [ ] Test with expired cards
- [ ] Test with insufficient funds
- [ ] Test network failures during payment
- [ ] Test concurrent payments for same order

### Security Testing
- [ ] Verify client secret is not exposed to client
- [ ] Test authentication requirements
- [ ] Verify order ownership validation
- [ ] Test for potential race conditions

## Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure `@stripe/stripe-js` and `@stripe/react-stripe-js` are installed
2. **Environment Variables**: Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
3. **Testing**: Run critical path tests to verify functionality
4. **Error Handling**: Add user-friendly error messages for common payment failures
5. **Webhooks**: Consider implementing Stripe webhooks for additional security (optional)

## Notes

- The implementation uses Stripe's Payment Intents API for secure payment processing
- All sensitive payment data is handled by Stripe's servers
- Orders are only marked as paid after successful payment confirmation
- Cart is cleared only after successful payment to prevent data loss
